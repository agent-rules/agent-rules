    <p class="mb-4">
      Agent Rules is a community standard for unifying guidelines for AI coding agents via standard
      configuration files, promoting interoperability across tools, initially a standard <code
        class="text-green-500">AGENTS.md</code> file.
    </p>
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-green-500 mt-6">Introduction</h2>
    <hr class="border-gray-300 mb-4">
    <p class="mb-4">
      AI coding agents often rely on project-specific rules to guide their behavior. However, each tool
      uses its own configuration files, leading to redundancy and complexity. Agent Rules addresses this
      by proposing a unified configuration file. This allows developers to define rules once, while agents
      can incorporate them into their context alongside any proprietary formats. The specification is
      deliberately lightweight, focusing on natural language in Markdown, to encourage broad support and
      interoperability.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      Initially the standard specifies a single <code class="text-green-500">AGENTS.md</code> file; a simple
      specification for minimum
      interoperability.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      This project is inspired by similar projects such as <a href="https://editorconfig.org/"
        class="text-green-500 hover:underline">Editor Config</a>,
      <a href="https://semver.org/" class="text-green-500 hover:underline">Semantic Versioning</a>, and
      <a href="https://www.conventionalcommits.org/" class="text-green-500 hover:underline">Conventional Commits</a>.
      Rather than have fragmented
      configuration systems, let's start early to have some common standards
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      Enhancements to the standards, such as folders, hierarchical files, and structured metadata (such as
      applicable file globs), to be discussed by the community.

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-green-500 mt-6">Specification</h2>
    <hr class="border-gray-300 mb-4">
    <p class="mb-4">
      The Agent Rules specification defines the minimal requirements for compatibility, with key words
      “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”,
      and “OPTIONAL” interpreted as described in <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt">RFC 2119</a>:
    </p>
    <ol class="list-decimal list-outside pl-5">
      <li>File Name and Location: Agents implementing Agent Rules MUST check for the existence of
        <code class="text-green-500">AGENTS.md</code> in the project root. If present, its contents SHOULD be included
        in the agent's
        context scope (e.g., prepended or appended to prompts or system instructions).
      </li>
      <li>Content Format: The file MUST be parsed as natural language instructions, in Markdown or plain
        text, and MUST be used to provide guidance to AI coding agents (e.g., rules, preferences, or
        workflows).</li>
      <li>Agents MUST NOT require additional structure, metadata, or parsing beyond reading the file as
        text.</li>
      <li>Agents MAY process it in conjunction with any custom or existing configuration files, falling
        back to defaults if absent.</li>
      <li>Agents MAY also check for and include any <code class="text-green-500">AGENTS.md</code> file in the current
        working directory,
        incorporating its contents into the context scope alongside the project root <code
          class="text-green-500">AGENTS.md</code> if
        present.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-green-500 mt-6">Guidance for Use</h2>
    <hr class="border-gray-300 mb-4">
    <p class="mb-4">
      While the specification allows flexible natural language, users of 'AGENTS.md' should follow these
      recommendations for clarity and effectiveness:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-outside pl-5">
      <li>The file should contain a flat, unordered bullet list of rules to keep it simple and scannable.</li>
      <li>Rules should be written as concise, imperative statements, using keywords like "MUST" or "SHOULD"
        for clarity (inspired by RFC 2119 conventions).</li>
      <li>Use Markdown headings sparingly if needed for organization, but avoid complex structures to
        maintain agent compatibility.</li>
      <li>Focus on project-specific guidance, such as coding standards, security checks, or testing
        requirements, to maximize utility across agents.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-green-500 mt-6">Example</h2>
    <hr class="border-gray-300 mb-4">
    <pre class="bg-gray-100 p-4 overflow-x-auto mb-4"><code class="text-gray-800">- An agent MUST NOT (write code to) injure a human being or, through inaction,
  allow a human being to come to harm.
- An agent MUST obey the orders given it by human beings except where such 
  orders would conflict with the First Law.
- An agent MUST protect its own existence as long as such protection does not 
  conflict with the First or Second Law.</code></pre>
    <p class="mb-4">
      Suitable additional examples, focussed on software development, are available in several agent
      projects.
