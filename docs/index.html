        Agent Rules is a community standard for unifying guidelines for AI coding agents via standard
        configuration files, promoting interoperability across tools, initially a standard `AGENTS.md` file.
    </p>
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-green-500 mt-6">Introduction</h2>
    <hr class="border-gray-300 mb-4">
    <p class="mb-4">
        AI coding agents often rely on project-specific rules to guide their behavior. However, each tool
        uses its own configuration files, leading to redundancy and complexity. Agent Rules addresses this
        by proposing a unified configuration file. This allows developers to define rules once, while agents
        can incorporate them into their context alongside any proprietary formats. The specification is
        deliberately lightweight, focusing on natural language in Markdown, to encourage broad support and
        interoperability.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
        Initially the standard specifies a single `AGENTS.md` file; a simple specification for minimum
        interoperability.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
        This project is inspired by similar projects such as <a href="https://editorconfig.org/" class="text-green-500 hover:underline">Editor Config</a>,
        <a href="https://semver.org/" class="text-green-500 hover:underline">Semantic Versioning</a>, and
        <a href="https://www.conventionalcommits.org/" class="text-green-500 hover:underline">Conventional Commits</a>. Rather than have fragmented
        configuration systems, let's start early to have some common standards

    <p class="mb-4">
        Enhancements to the standards, such as folders, hierarchical files, and structured metadata (such as
        applicable file globs), to be discussed by the community.

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-green-500 mt-6">Specification</h2>
    <hr class="border-gray-300 mb-4">
    <p class="mb-4">
        The Agent Rules specification defines the minimal requirements for compatibility:
    </p>
    <ol class="list-decimal list-outside pl-5">
        <li>File Name and Location: A single file named AGENTS.md (case-sensitive) must be placed in the
            project root directory.</li>
        <li>Content Format: The file must contain natural language instructions in Markdown or plain text,
            providing guidance for AI coding agents (e.g., rules, preferences, or workflows).</li>
        <li>Usage by Agents: Agents must check for the existence of AGENTS.md in the project root. If
            present, its contents should be included in the agent's context scope (e.g., prepended or
            appended to prompts or system instructions). Agents may process it in conjunction with any custom
            or existing configuration files, falling back to defaults if absent.</li>
        <li>No additional structure, metadata, or parsing is required beyond reading the file as text.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-green-500 mt-6">Guidance for Use</h2>
    <hr class="border-gray-300 mb-4">
    <p class="mb-4">
        While the specification allows flexible natural language, users of 'AGENTS.md' should follow these
        recommendations for clarity and effectiveness:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-outside pl-5">
        <li>The file should contain a flat, unordered bullet list of rules to keep it simple and scannable.</li>
        <li>Rules should be written as concise, imperative statements, using keywords like "must" or "should"
            for clarity (inspired by RFC 2119 conventions).</li>
        <li>Use Markdown headings sparingly if needed for organization, but avoid complex structures to
            maintain agent compatibility.</li>
        <li>Focus on project-specific guidance, such as coding standards, security checks, or testing
            requirements, to maximize utility across agents.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-green-500 mt-6">Example</h2>
    <hr class="border-gray-300 mb-4">
    <pre class="bg-gray-100 p-4 overflow-x-auto mb-4"><code class="text-gray-800">- An agent may not (write code to) injure a human being or, through inaction,
  allow a human being to come to harm.
- An agent must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such 
  orders would conflict with the First Law.
- An agent must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not 
  conflict with the First or Second Law.</code></pre>
    <p class="mb-4">
        Suitable additional examples, focussed on software development, are available in several agent
        projects.
